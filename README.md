# OPTIMIZING-DIAGNOSTIC-DECISION-SUPPORT-USING-PRE-PRUNED-DECISION-TREES

This project demonstrates how to use a Decision Tree Classifier to predict the presence of a disease based on several input features. The code preprocesses a dataset, trains a decision tree model, evaluates the model's performance, and visualizes the decision tree and predictions.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is in CSV format, containing various features related to the diagnosis of a disease. These features can include medical attributes such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, gender, and the target variable indicating the presence or absence of the disease.
<br><br>
the following columns are in the dataset:
<br><br>
<b>Blood Pressure:</b> Categorical values ('Low', 'Normal', 'High')<br>
<b>Cholesterol Level:</b> Categorical values ('Low', 'Normal', 'High')<br>
<b>Outcome Variable:</b> The target variable indicating the disease outcome ('Positive' for the presence of disease, 'Negative' for no disease)<br>
<b>Disease:</b> Categorical values indicating the disease type<br>
<b>Gender:</b> Categorical values ('Male', 'Female')<br>
Make sure your dataset has the required columns, or modify the code to suit your dataset structure.<br>
